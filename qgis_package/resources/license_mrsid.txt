LizardTech Computer Software License Agreement for MrSID Decode SDKs

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY.

This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or a
single entity, and hereinafter referred to as "Licensee") and Celartem, Inc., doing business as LizardTech
("LizardTech").

LIZARDTECH is engaged in the business of designing, developing, and marketing MrSID Decode SDKs (including
the GeoExpress Decode SDK and the LiDAR Compressor SDK) (collectively "DSDK"). DSDK consists of libraries
that allow licensees to write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to view MrSID-formatted files
and other supported file types.
LICENSEE desires to design, develop or market software products that use DSDK to permit (among other
functionality developed by LICENSEE) an end-user to view *. sid-formatted files and other supported formatted files
("Licensed Products").

In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH agrees to license DSDK to
LICENSEE for LICENSEE's use in the development of Licensed Products, and LICENSEE's subsequent
sublicensing of DSDK with the Licensed Products pursuant to the terms and conditions which follow.

1. LICENSE GRANT
1.1 DSDK. DSDK and any and all associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation
provided with DSDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties, and is licensed, not sold. LICENSEE shall not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or
decompile or otherwise seek to discover the source code or trade secrets of DSDK. LICENSEE shall not use DSDK
to develop products or allow others to develop products that encode files into the MrSID format.
1.2 Development License Grant. LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive license to install DSDK
on a reasonable number of CPUs in LICENSEE's own facilities only for its own internal use and development of
Licensed Products that use DSDK to view *.sid files.
1.3 Distribution License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH hereby grants to
LICENSEE a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable right to distribute DSDK in object code format with the
Licensed Products. For avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE is not permitted to distribute DSDK source code libraries.
LICENSEE may distribute DSDK with the Licensed Products to sublicensees (and such sublicensees may further
sublicense DSDK with the Licensed Products to other sublicensees) provided:
(a) a notice regarding LIZARDTECH or its licensors' ownership rights shall be provided with the Licensed Products
as set forth in Subsection 2.2 below;
(b) DSDK shall only be sublicensed under license terms as set forth in Subsection 1.3(d) below and any and all
distribution of DSDK with the Licensed Product does not cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, DSDK
to become subject to the terms of any Open Source license, including but not limited to the GNU Public License;
(c) any and all distribution of DSDK shall not (i) create, or purport to create, any obligations for LIZARDTECH or its
licensors with respect to DSDK; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under
LIZARDTECH or its licensors' intellectual property or proprietary rights in DSDK;
(d) DSDK shall be sublicensed to any and all sublicensees subject to a license agreement that provides
LIZARDTECH and its licensors with the same protections and requirements as set forth in Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2, 3,
4, and 6.1. For the avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE and any and all sublicensees may not sublicense DSDK
separately from the Licensed Products.
1.4 Rights in DSDK. LIZARDTECH and its licensors retain all right, title to, and ownership of all applicable intellectual
property rights such as patent, copyrights and trade secrets in DSDK (including Updates as defined in Section 2.3)
and any associated documentation. Without limiting its rights in any way, LIZARDTECH hereby specifically reserves
the worldwide nonexclusive right to develop, use, reproduce and distribute DSDK directly to other integrators,
distributors and/or end-users. DSDK, including features and related information, are unpublished software, trade
secret, confidential or proprietary information of LIZARDTECH or its licensors. DSDK is a "commercial item," as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), any use, modification, reproduction,
release, performance, display, or disclosure of DSDK by the U. S. government shall be solely in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 1.3, LICENSEE shall not rent, sell, lease,
disclose or otherwise provide DSDK, associated documentation or any related information to any third party and will
use such efforts, and in no event less than a commercially reasonable effort, to protect DSDK, associated
documentation or related information as LICENSEE uses to protect its own trade secret, confidential or proprietary
information.

2. OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSEE
2.1 Trademark Usage. LIZARDTECH grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use and
display LIZARDTECH's trademarks, logos or other elements of its branding (collectively "Trademarks") in connection
with LICENSEE'S license rights granted hereunder with respect to DSDK, provided, however, such use shall be
subject to the terms in the Trademarks: Limited License provision located in the Terms of Use at
www.lizardtech.com. LICENSEE agrees to abide by such terms and LICENSEE further agrees to monitor the above
referenced Trademarks: Limited License provision for any updates or amendments to such terms.
2.2 Proprietary Rights Notice. LICENSEE must include in all Licensed Products all ownership/copyright, Trademark,
trade secret and other intellectual or proprietary rights notices accompanying the Licensed Products in the About Box

to third-party software incorporated in the Licensed Products. At a minimum, LICENSEE shall include the following
notice in all Licensed Products:
Portions of this computer program are copyright (c) 1995-2016 Celartem, Inc., doing business as LizardTech. All
rights reserved.
2.3 Licensed Product Support and Updates. LICENSEE is responsible for the support of all Licensed Products.
LICENSEE agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement Updates provided by LIZARDTECH into the
next scheduled release of the Licensed Products. LIZARDTECH may, but is not obligated to, provide such Updates
to DSDK. Updates shall mean maintenance revisions that correct identified errors in, or provide bug fixes for DSDK
and may also include support for additional file formats.

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. LIZARDTECH AND ITS LICENSORS PROVIDE DSDK "AS IS" AND WITH ALL
FAULTS. LIZARDTECH, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE DSDK,

DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, DATA, USE OR
REVENUE, OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation of liability shall apply
regardless of the form of action whether in contract or in tort, including by negligence or any other basis.

5. TERM AND TERMINATION
5.1 Term and Termination. The initial term of this Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date of this
Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if
the other party is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the thirty
(30) day period. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon the delivery of thirty (30) days prior
written notice of termination to the other party.
5.2 Obligations. Upon Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to LICENSEE shall
terminate and LICENSEE must return to LIZARDTECH or destroy all copies of DSDK in its possession, custody, or
control, whether modified or not. In the event this Agreement is terminated without cause, LICENSEE may (a) retain
a reasonable number of copies of Licensed Products, not to exceed five (5) copies, for purposes of its internal use
solely to facilitate customer support for existing customers only; and (b) exhaust its current stock of Licensed
Products over a period of no more than thirty (30) days after the date of termination. Any remaining inventory at the
end of such period must be destroyed.
5.3 Survival Provisions. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 6.3 and
6.6 of this Agreement survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

6. MISCELLANEOUS
6.1 Export Controls. LICENSEE shall not export or reexport DSDK or any direct product thereof without the
appropriate United States or foreign government export licenses, notifications or approvals.
6.2 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the
laws of the United States of America, and in the absence of applicable federal law, the laws of the State of Oregon
will apply. Further, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including but not limited to Section
6.2, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution), all claims, demands, complaints and disputes will be
subject to the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601-613), the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C.  1346(a) and  1491), or the
Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C.  1346(b), 2401-2402, 2671-2672, 2674-2680), as applicable, or other
applicable governing authority. For the avoidance of doubt, if LICENSEE is an agency of the federal government of
the United States, then LICENSEE's attorney fee obligations are only applicable to the extent they would not cause
LICENSEE to violate any applicable law (e.g., the Anti-Deficiency Act), and LICENSEE has any legally required
authorization or authorizing statute.
6.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement s sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to
the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussion(s) between them. No modification of or amendment to this
Agreement will be effective unless set forth in writing signed by officers of both parties hereto.
6.4 Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and either delivered by hand or
sent by prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by nationally recognized overnight courier
service, addressed to the other party at the address shown at the beginning of this Agreement or at such other
address for which such party gives notice hereunder. Such notice will be deemed to have been given when delivered
or, if delivery is not accomplished due to action or inaction of the addressee, when tendered.
6.5 Assignment and Binding Effect. LICENSEE may not transfer or assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of LIZARDTECH, except to a successor in interest or purchaser of all or
substantially all of LICENSEE's assets which specifically assumes the obligations of this Agreement. LICENSEE will
notify LIZARDTECH within ten (10) days of such event. Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and assigns.
6.6 Partial Invalidity and No Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to
renegotiate in good faith any term held invalid and to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision. No
waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement will be valid or binding on either party unless the same will have
been mutually assented to in writing by an officer of both parties. The failure of either party at any time to enforce any
of the provisions of the Agreement, or the failure to require at any time performance by the other party of any of the
provisions of this Agreement, will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in
any way affect the validity of an effort by either party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.
